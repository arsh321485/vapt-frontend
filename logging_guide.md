## 🔍 Understanding Confidence Scores

The confidence score indicates how many attributes were successfully identified:

- **100%**: All 4 attributes identified (Neckline, Silhouette, Waistline, Sleeves)
- **75%**: 3 out of 4 attributes identified
- **50%**: 2 out of 4 attributes identified  
- **25%**: 1 out of 4 attributes identified
- **0%**: No attributes identified (all marked as "Unknown")

## 📈 Monitoring Quality in Real-Time

### Good Signs ✅
- High confidence scores (75%+)
- Detailed, descriptive captions
- Low number of "Unknown" attributes
- Consistent processing times

### Warning Signs ⚠️
- Many invalid URLs
- Low confidence scores consistently
- Generic captions like "a woman in a dress"
- High number of processing failures

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting with Logs

### If you see many "Unknown" attributes:
1. Check if the captions are descriptive enough
2. Consider if the images actually show the fashion details clearly
3. The AI might need more specific fashion terminology in the images

### If you see many failed URLs:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the URLs are still accessible
3. Some servers might be blocking automated requests

### If processing is very slow:
1. Check the "Average time per image" in progress summaries
2. Consider processing smaller batches
3. Network speed might be a factor

## 📝 Log Files

The system creates multiple log outputs:

1. **Console Output**: Real-time progress display
2. **fashion_extraction.log**: Complete processing log file
3. **Summary Reports**: Statistical analysis of results

## 🎨 Using the Enhanced Logging

To run with detailed logging:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source fashion_env/bin/activate

# Run the main script
python3 fashion_attribute_extractor.py
```

The enhanced logging will automatically show:
- ✅ Every successful extraction with full details
- ⚠️ Every invalid URL with clear warnings  
- ❌ Every processing failure with error details
- 📊 Progress summaries every 10 images
- 🎯 Final statistics and quality metrics

This gives you complete visibility into the extraction process and helps ensure high-quality results!
